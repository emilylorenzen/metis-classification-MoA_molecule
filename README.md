Classification module objectives:
- Evaluate different classification algorithms in terms of performance, interpretability, and complexity
- Apply hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to increase classification model performane 

#Mechanism of action predictions based on molecular properties

Classified molecules as GPCR ligands based solely on molecular properties that were calculable via python packes rdkit and mordred.
